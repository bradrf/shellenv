* in general, after entering a prefix, wait and helm will offer suggestions

* extend smartparens inserted items
  * to right: C-)
  * to left: C-(

* force expand at point (hippie-expand): M-/
  * cycle by M-/ more

* Super-p: projectile prefix
  * open file: f
    * open file in ANY project: F
  * grep: s g
  * ag: s s (faster grep with the silver searcher!)
  * regenerate tags: R
  * open other project: p

* Select (mark) current function (defun): C-M-h
  * use C-= to select current "context" and keep hitting it to "expand selection"

* Select from point to next char, repeatedly: M-z (zap)

* Insert blank line regardless of point:
  * below: shift-return
  * above: C-shift-return

* Jump back to previous position in buffer: C-u C-space
  * to previous position in last buffer: C-x C-space

* Grep from open file command: C-s
  * RECURSIVE: C-u-C-s

* Open visited file list from open list: C-h (think "history")

* Open RECENT file: C-c-f (think like C-x-f)

* Switch to previous directory (of perhaps last opened file):
  * after C-x-f, use M-p (or M-n)

* Rename file and buffer: C-c r

* Open shell init file(s): C-c S

* Super-m m: magit status
  * see diff by going to file and hitting <TAB>
    * or, C-x v =
  * 's' to stage file ('u' to unstage)
  * 'c' to commit staged files

* jj: jump to beginning of word
* jk: jump to char
* jl: jump to line
* s . (or C-c j): jump to work in any window

* Shift-super up/down: scroll-in-place

* Find symbol in file (aka "imenu" semantic search): C-c h i

* Find symbol anywhere! C-c i

* Replace (refactor/rename) symbol at point: anzu-query-replace-at-cursor

* Replace (refactor/rename) across all files in project: C-c p r

* Look at the full kill ring (all items copied): M-y

* Use Super-` to switch between frames

* tramp:
  * C-x C-f /scp:<host>:<remote_file>
  * C-x C-f /su::/etc/hosts
  * C-x C-f /sudo::/etc/hosts

* comment: C-x C-; (again to uncomment)
